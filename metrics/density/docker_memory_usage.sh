#  Description of the test:
#  This test launches a number of containers in idle mode,
#  It will then sleep for a configurable period of time to allow
#  any memory optimisations to 'settle, and then checks the
#  amount of memory used by all the containers to come up with
#  an average (using the PSS measurements)
#  This test uses smem tool to get the memory used.
